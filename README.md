# DuckDNS IP Updater

An small java app to update your IP on DuckDNS.


## What you should know:

- You need to change the "token" string to your DuckDNS token.
- On the "domain" string you just name "yourdomain" not "yourdomain.duckdns.org".

Also I ask you for forgiveness for not having any comments on my code, I lost the original and had to decopile my .JAR with JDCore.
