Note: I made a .NET Core version and discontinued support for this one. Check here: https://github.com/pedroCX486/duckdns_netcore_updater

# DuckDNS IP Updater

An small Java app to update your IP on DuckDNS.


## What you should know:

- You need to change the "token" string to your DuckDNS token.
- You need to change the "domain" string, you just need to put the domain name (eg. yourdomain not yourdomain.duckdns.org).
