Update: I'm currently porting this to .NET Core 2.2. Should be up soon.

# DuckDNS IP Updater

An small java app to update your IP on DuckDNS.


## What you should know:

- You need to change the "token" string to your DuckDNS token.
- On the "domain" string you just name "yourdomain" not "yourdomain.duckdns.org".
